Goal: Create Distributed, Load-Balanced, Auto-Scaled, High-Available, Secured WordPress Application that has Web Server and DB Server separated

Stage 1:

Create Own VPC
Why? 

The default VPC has its main route table connected to IGW. This prevents us not to have private subnet.

Console->Network->VPC

Do not use Wizard

Let us create manually

Select Your VPCs

Create VPC

	-- vpc name: ep33-myvpc
	-- CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16 = 65531 IPs

Use Filter to select only your VPC

Create IGW
Attach IGW to ep33-myvpc

Create Subnets
	-- private subnets [MySQL DB]
		-- AZ-a
			ep33-private-subnet-A - 10.0.1.0/24
		-- AZ-b
			ep33-private-subnet-B - 10.0.2.0/24
	-- public subnets [WordPress Web Servers]
		-- AZ-a
			ep33-public-subnet-A - 10.0.3.0/24
		-- AZ-b
			ep33-public-subnet-B - 10.0.4.0/24

Create NAT service [MySQL to get installed and additional patches]
	-- IGW for both inbound and outbound traffic
	-- NAT Gateway is for only outbound traffic and its return traffic
	[SGs are stateful - it can remember if an incoming traffic is part of a return traffic]

	[ACLs are stateless - it cannot remember any return traffics]

	-- Create an EIP
	-- Create NAT
		-- associate it with ep33-A-public-subnet
		-- associate the EIP
		-- ep33-nat

Create Route Tables

	-- Main route table should not have any modifications, as a best practice
	-- Public Route Tables - IGW
		-- ep33-public-rt-A: ep33-public-subnet-A and Routing to Local and IGW [0.0.0.0/0]
		-- ep33-public-rt-B: ep33-public-subnet-B and Routing to Local and IGW [0.0.0.0/0]
	-- NAT Route Tables [NAT]
		-- ep33-NAT-RouteTable: ep33-private-subnet-A and ep33-private-subnet-B Routing to Local and NAT [0.0.0.0/0]
		
Select Your VPC
	-- Action: DNS Hostname: YES

Your VPC is now ready for big plan

Prepare Security Groups for Wordpress and MySQL servers

	-- Prepare Wordpress SG
		-- Name: ep33-WORDPRESS-SG
		-- VPC: ep33-myvpc [not default VPC]
		-- Inbound: 
			-- HTTP - 80 - 0.0.0.0/0
			-- SSH - 22 - MyIP

	-- Prepare MySQL SG
		-- Name: ep33-MySQL-sg
		-- VPC: ep33-myvpc
		-- Inbound:
			-- MySQL/Aurora - 3306 - from ep33-WORDPRESS-SG

Create MySQL DB
	-- Launch Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
	-- t2.micro
	-- VPC: ep33-myvpc
	-- subnet: ep33-private-subnet-A
	-- Public IP: Disable
	-- private IP: 10.0.1.100
	-- Advanced: User Data
		-- Copy paste MySQL installation shell script
Create Wordpress Server
	-- Launch Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
	-- t2.micro
	-- VPC: ep33-myvpc
	-- subnet: ep33-public-subnet-A
	-- Public IP: Enable
	-- Advanced:
		-- Copy paste Wordpress installation shell script
		-- Ensure that the DB_HOST name: is 10.0.1.100
After this one, you can view Wordpress page using public IP of Wordpress instance

Complete Wordpress installation to complete the MySQL table creation

Stop WP server
Start WP server

You will now see that the WP is not properly showing

WP stores the the IP address of the first time instance as its site url and home url in MySQL DB

We need to update

Update as per the WordpressCustomization Text file

To prevent future IP clashes, we need to have a sub domain name

Go to Route 53 under Console->Network

	-- Select Hosted Zones
	-- Select epsubhash.in hosted zone
	-- Create Recordset
	-- Name: ep33 [.epsubhash.in]
	-- IPv4
	-- No Alias
	-- Value: Public IP Address of WP server

Now you can see your WP running with http://ep33.epsubhash.in

Do not stop or terminate WP server and MYSQL server now....
