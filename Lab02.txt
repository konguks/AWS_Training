Creating 2 Windows Servers in 2 AZs and cloning and attaching EBS volumes from one AZ to another

Use case: you have a Windows server running in one AZ and you have attached an additional EBS volume in which you have stored some critical data and apps. You want to make copy of this Volume and distribute to other instances in the same region but in different AZs

-- Start 1 Windows server AZ-a
-- Start another Windows Server in AZ-b

-- Create a new Volume and attach to AZ-a server
-- Connect to Windows server using RDP protocol
-- Use Server manager to
	-- Make the attached Volume Online
	-- Make it formatted
-- Install all necessary data or apps into the new volume

-- Save all the contents

-- On console
	-- select the volume which in use on the Windows server AZ-a
	-- Create a snap-shot - Point-in-Time - copy
-- All snapshots are stored in S3 but not in your S3 space
-- You will be accessing them only through Console-EC2->Snapshot facility or through CLI, you cannot use S3 Console or CLI to manage snapshots

-- Create a new Volume with snapshot
-- Create a new Volume
-- Select your snapshot ID by searching either tag value or snapshot ID. [Snapshots are not limited to your private snaps, they may include publically available]
