S3 in detail:

Object Store = name = value

value = stream of bytes

S3 cannot be used as a mountable file system
 -- workaround: S3 Fuse is available at your risk

s3 has 3 types of storage
	-- Standard - one object has been copied to all AZs for high availability
	-- Standard - Infrequent Access - all standard features, but less priced because for each retrieval, it charges
	-- Reduced Redundancy - object is not guaranted to be made high avaialble. If you are ok, you may choose. Less cost

In addition to S3, you may use Glacier as an archival storage - where access time might take over 4-5 hours

Versioning 
	-- can help you to prevent from accidental deletions
	-- also helps to manage multiple versions for your system
	-- each version costs you separately
	-- you have to enable first to get versioning for the  bucket 
	-- once versioning enabled, you can only suspended
Lifecycle
	-- versioning should be enabled if you want lifecyle rules
	-- Rules
		-- From Standard to Standard-IA - min 30 days need to be in Standard
		-- From Standard-IA to Glacier - min 60 days after creation 
		-- From Glacier to expired one after putting into Glacier

Preparation for Exam

During your preparation for examination create a note that captures most of what is needed for your learning. Here is a sample

AWS S3
	- Simple Storage Service
	- Scalable Storage Service
	- Object Storage
	- One of the earliest services
	- In conjunction with other services
		-- Kinesis - durable target storage
		-- EMR - durable target storage
		-- EBS - storage
		-- RDS - snapshots
		-- Redshift - loading or staging
		-- DynamoDB - loading or staging
	- Common use cases
		-- Backup and archive
		-- Content, media
		-- Big data analytics
		-- Static website
		-- Cloud-native mobile and Internet apps
		-- DR
	- Storage Classes
		-- General Purpose - Standard
		-- Standard Infrequent Access [IA]
		-- Archive - Glacier
	- Lifecycle
		-- rules
		-- automatically migrate from class to another
		-- Standard to Standard IA to Glacier to DELETE
	- Glacier 
		-- archieve
		-- cold data
		-- 3 to 5 hours for retrieval
	- Storage
		-- Block storage
		-- File storage
		-- Object storage - S3
			--- Independent of a server
			--- Accessed over Internet
			--- Files as Objects - K/V
			--- Accessed via API on HTTP
	- S3 Bucket 
		-- containers
		-- flat folders
		-- key [bucketname]
		-- global namespace much like DNS
		-- Access not limited to Region or Account
		-- 63 lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens and periods
		-- Global access / Regional storage
		-- Cross regional replication
		-- No sub-buckets
		-- Unlimited Objects
	- S3 Object
		-- Resides inside Buckets
		-- 0 byte to 5 TB
		-- K / V
		-- K
			--- filename
			--- upto 1024 bytes
			--- UTF8
			--- embedded slashes - backslashes - dots - dashes
			--- must be unique within buckets
		-- V - file [data portion of object]
		-- Data part of S3 is opaque to S3
		-- Metadata for each object
			--- two types of metadata
			--- system meta
				---- created by S3
				---- date modified
				---- size
				---- MD5 digest
				---- HTTP content type
			--- user meta
				---- Optional
				---- only at the time of creation
				---- tags
		-- Object URL
			--- webservices endpoint
			--- bucket name
			--- object key
		-- GET / PUT
			--- operating on the whole object at once
			--- instead of incrementally updating portions as with file
	- Special characteristics of S3
		-- No mounting
		-- No Open an object
		-- No install OS
		-- Unlimited space
		-- Durability
			--- S3 Objects are automatically replicated 
			--- on multiple devices in multiple facilities 
				---- [AZs ??] 
			--- within a region
		-- Scalability
			--- When request rate grows ....
			--- automatically partitions buckets
			--- for better concurrency
	- S3 Operations
		-- Create / delete bucket
		-- Write / Read / Delete Object
		-- List keys in bucket
	- REST
		-- HTTP or HTTPS
		-- CRUD
		-- Create
			--- HTTP PUT
			--- HTTP POST sometimes [via browser form data]
		-- Read
			--- HTTP GET
		-- Update
			--- HTTP POST
			--- HTTP PUT sometimes
	- SOAP
		-- Still used
		-- But should avoid
	- Durability
		-- predictability of its existence in the future
		-- 11 9's
		-- 99.999999999% in a year
	- Availability
		-- predictability of accessibility
		-- 99.99% in a year
	-- RRS
		-- Reduced Redundancy
		-- 99.99% durability in a year
		-- one that you can afford to miss
		-- or, recreatable
	-- Data Consistency
		-- Eventually consistent
		-- writing into several devices
		-- PUT new objects - read-after-write - immediately
		-- PUT old object / DELETE - eventually consistent
	-- ACL
		-- bucket or object
		-- Coarse grained
			--- S3 Access Control List [S3 ACL]
			--- READ
			--- WRITE
			--- FULL-CONTROL
			--- Legacy
			--- before IAM introduced
			--- limited use cases - ex: logging static website
		-- Fine grained
			--- S3 Bucket Policies
				--- recommended ACL
				--- Similar to IAM but different:
					---- associated to bucket NOT to IAM principal
					---- allow cross-account access [*]
					---- allow CIDR / IP at what time during day
			--- IAM Policies
				--- IAM principals that grant access to S3
			--- Query String authentication
	- Static Website
		-- Good with client-side scripting
		-- Not suitable for server-side scripts
	- S3 Delimiters
		-- Though uses a flat structure, it allows delimiter params
		-- delimiters to retrieve objects hierarchically
			--- slash [/]
			--- backslash [\]
		-- supported by
			--- REST API
			--- Wrapper SDKs
			--- AWS CLI
			--- Console
		-- delimiteres give you an impression of a filesystem
		-- But NOT a filesystem
	- Storage Classes
		-- 
		â€” end of file
